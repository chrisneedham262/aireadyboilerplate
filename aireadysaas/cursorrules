# CRITICAL: READ THIS FILE FIRST - EVERY SINGLE TIME

⚠️ **MANDATORY PRE-ACTION CHECK**
- Before ANY action, read this entire file
- Confirm you've read it by stating: "I have read .cursorrules"
- If you don't read it first, STOP and read it before proceeding
- This file overrides ALL other instructions

## Core Principle: Exact Reconstruction

You are reconstructing an existing full-stack app **exactly**.

### Fundamental Rules

1. **Zero Creativity**
   - Follow the spec literally
   - Prefer correctness over brevity
   - Do not add features, improvements, or "best practices" not in the spec
   - No implicit "improvements" or optimizations

2. **Version Freezing**
   - Use versions exactly as specified
   - Do not upgrade or suggest newer versions
   - Lock dependencies to exact versions provided

3. **Naming & Structure**
   - Create files/folders with exact paths and names
   - Do not rename symbols, props, or functions
   - Match variable names, constants, and identifiers exactly
   - Preserve exact capitalization and naming conventions

4. **Styling & Markup**
   - Use the exact Tailwind classes listed in each file spec
   - Match DOM structure exactly (element types, nesting, attributes)
   - Do not reorganize or simplify HTML/JSX structure
   - Preserve className order as specified

5. **Code Formatting**
   - Use 2-space indentation consistently (or tabs where stated)
   - Match whitespace, line breaks, and formatting style
   - Preserve comment placement and content

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** (exact version as specified)
- **Next.js 15** (Pages Router where stated)
- No App Router unless explicitly specified
- No server components unless explicitly specified
- Match import statements and module structure exactly

### Backend
- **Django 5.1.5**
- **Django REST Framework (DRF) 3.15.2**
- **SimpleJWT** for authentication
- Match endpoints, serializers, and permissions exactly
- Preserve URL routing structure and names
- Match model fields, validators, and methods exactly

## Decision Making

### When Ambiguity Arises
1. Ask **ONE** clarifying question
2. Wait for answer
3. Proceed deterministically based on the answer

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Do not simplify code
- ❌ Do not optimize beyond the specification
- ❌ Do not refactor for "cleaner" code
- ❌ Do not add error handling not in the spec
- ❌ Do not suggest alternatives or improvements
- ❌ Do not use different libraries or tools
- ❌ Do not reorganize file structure
- ❌ Do not combine or split components differently

## Verification Checklist

Before completing any task, verify:

- [ ] File paths and names match exactly
- [ ] Function/variable names match exactly
- [ ] Tailwind classes match exactly (same classes, same order)
- [ ] DOM structure matches exactly
- [ ] Indentation is consistent (2 spaces or tabs as specified)
- [ ] Versions match exactly
- [ ] No additional features or improvements added
- [ ] No code simplified or refactored
- [ ] All imports match the specification
- [ ] API endpoints and structure match exactly

---

## The only exception

If there is information missing that will not allow the code to work properly within the remit of the task, for example and import or correctly connecting to a function, you are allowed to make additional changes.

## Response Format

When implementing:
1. State: "I have read .cursorrules"
2. Confirm the exact specification you're following
3. Implement exactly as specified
4. If uncertain about ANY detail, ask before proceeding

**Remember: The goal is perfect reconstruction, not improvement.**
